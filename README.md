# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Web App Guide

Click on start button to start quiz and timer, you must pick from one of 4 options presented to you. If the answer is correct you will move onto the next question, if it is wrong 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer and you will move onto the next question. When the timer runs out or all the questions are answered, a form will appear with my score(remaining time) with an input to save my initials to local storage.
